description: Cliffs line both eastern and western sides of the field ahead of you. The animal skeletons no longer litter the ground. Thereâ€™s nothing special or noteworthy here. Some environments are just transitional, not everything has to be special or have a gimmick. Just move on to the next area. 
items: seriously: You need something special here too? Fine the C-137 droids shoot your stomach with a portal gun that transports your intestines to another timeline. You die in a mundane field because you thought every single scene needs to be some complex entertaining trope. Adventure over. That what you wanted? No? Then just go onto the next area.
