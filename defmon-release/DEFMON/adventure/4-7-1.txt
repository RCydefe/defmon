description: You walk into a wide field with a steep cliff to the northern side. As you make your way across the field, you take note of all the different types of animal skeletons scattered about. It’s a wonder how the overgrown field is able to hide so many. The field stretches to the south, but you see you are approaching a beach to the west. You can investigate the field, or see the wildlife at the beach. Or both. Don’t let us tell you what to do.
