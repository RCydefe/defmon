description: You walk through the rows of homes built into the mountain side, relaxing a bit as the sounds of life being lived temporarily melts away the concerns of your journey. Itâ€™s strange that with all the activities in the area, not a single person has been seen or met on the road. A lantern flickers in the windows of the shack high on the hill. You head to the building in hopes of speaking to whomever may be inside.
