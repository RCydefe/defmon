description: An acrid smell reminiscent of forgotten soggy gym socks fills your nostrils. Heavy machinery rolls on through carrying a melange of civilization’s detritus. Dust and mold lay heavy in the air as a mound clad in corvids thrusts into the grey skies above you. To your east, rocky wastelands grow into the distance. To your west is a dark looming forest. Impassible crags flowing with water sit to your north.
items: Trash: A moist tras hbag full of more empty trash bags oozes even more onto the floor. You don’t want this. I don't wan’t this. Nobody wants this.
