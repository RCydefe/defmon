description: Sand breaks free from your cheeks as you walk along the bank. The creekâ€™s current flows steadily from the waterfall, feeding the plant life and pushing debris down stream where it jams against fallen trees and creates a natural dam. The mountains grow brown and rocky to the north, while the deep forest to the south howls as a terrifying wind whips through the trees. Distracted by the swaying trees, you step into a deep puddle and fill your shoes with water.
